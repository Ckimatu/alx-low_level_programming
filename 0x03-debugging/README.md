Debugging projects:

File 0-main.c - tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

File 1-main.c -  Comments out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

File 2-largest_number.c -  prints the largest of three integers

File 3-print_remaining_days.c - converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration
